# **Frontend**

**The main frontend implementation for TK Chat can be found in the [TK CHAT repository](https://github.com/SM1LE21/TK_CHAT/tree/main).**

For this project, we integrated the chat functionality directly into the existing React frontend for the portfolio website.

Please note that this directory only includes a placeholder README to explain TK Chat, as the files were immediately implemented into the website project. You won't find additional frontend files here; they are part of the main website's React codebase.
